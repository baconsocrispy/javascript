# JavaScript

## Introduction

This repository collects the JavaScript projects I completed as part of the 'JavaScript Course' at The Tech Academy. The course is an introduction to the fundamentals of JavaScript and builds on earlier lessons in HTML and CSS.

* Pizza Project
* Tic Tac Toe
* Calculator

## Pizza Project

This project required us to create a mock pizza menu with options for selecting size and toppings. We utilized JavaScript to handle the logic for a simplified receipt based on the options selected by the user.

## Tic Tac Toe

As part of the course, I built a functional tic tac toe game, using HTML and CSS for layout, with game logic implemented in JavaScript. The game made use of CSS canvas and JavaScript to animate 'win-lines' at the end of a won game.

## Calculator

Similar to the Tic Tac Toe game, I created a functional calculator, laid out in HTML and CSS, with computing logic handled by JavaScript.
